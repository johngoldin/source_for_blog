This website is intended to describe some of my personal R projects. It may include some posts on other general subjects.

This is my first attempt to use the [**blogdown**](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown) package
to setup and maintain a website via [**Hugo**](https://gohugo.io/) and available
via [**GitHub Pages**](https://pages.github.com/). This site uses the [Hyde theme](http://themes.gohugo.io/hyde/) in Hugo.

My first post describes [how I set up this site]({{< relref "2017-02-11-how-i-setup-this-site.md" >}}).

Previously I did some [posts on WordPress](https://caniblogtoo.wordpress.com/) (which I have recreated in this blog) and before that
I did some on [Blogger](http://goldinoldie.blogspot.com/).

I am semi-retired. Until 2011 I was the Director of Institutional Research at Yale University. The "semi" part is that I still work for Yale about ten hours a week.
