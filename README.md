# pages-source
This is the source material for a Hugo web site. In the config.toml file I indicate that the
site itslef will be created in a different RStudio project: johngoldin.github.io.
To publish the blog, I push that site to GitHub. Although pages-source also has a GitHub
repository, whether or not I push changes to this repository doesn't directly affect the web
site at johngoldin.github.io.

[Here](https://johngoldin.github.io/2017/02/11/how-i-set-up-this-site/) is a more detailed description of how I use `pages-source` and GitHub to publish the web site.
